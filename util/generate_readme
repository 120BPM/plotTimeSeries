# plot_timeseries

The plot_timeseries is a simple utility for plotting a timeseries graph using R
with some flexibility. This is handy for e.g. plotting KPI values over time.

## Requirements

To use this script, you need to [install R](http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and then get the \`getopt\` package. 
To install the \`getopt\` package, fire up R and type in something like:

    install.packages('getopt', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')

## Usage

EOT

../plot_timeseries -h 2>/dev/null | sed "s/^/    /"

cat << EOT

## Testing

There is a test directory with some lovely testy stuff in it:

    test/test_data - a directory with some test csv files in it
    test/output    - a directory that the test script dumps images into
    run_test       - a bash script that calls plot_timeseries to generate a few graphs

    $ cd test
    $ ./run_test 
    $ ls output/*.png

## Examples

Example graphs are shown below. These are produced by from the data in the \`test\` directory
